# **Innerworks Coding Test**

Welcome to the innerworks coding test. You will have 2 hours to complete 7 questions. The first section contains 5 questions that are classic coding interview questions. The second section contains 2 longer form questions, that will test your coding ability on more realistic problems.

Please try to spend around 1 hour on each section, as they will be judged evenly. If you reach 1 hour on section 1, please move on to section 2, you can always come back at the end.

If you get part-way through a question, please don't delete your code! We want to see your attempt even if it is unfinished.

There are two bonus questions at the end of section 1, please only attempt them once you have finished **both** sections to a standard you are happy with.

Section 1 will simply be judging the way you tackle the problem, do not worry about complexity (until you get to the bonus questions, or unless specified as in question 3) and do not worry about code comments etc.

Section 2 will judge the way you approach a problem, the quality of your code (including comments) and the application of good programming practise. Please add your solutions into the folders marked "Solution".

We know that you can use AI tools, and look up solutions online (at least for section 1). Please refrain from plugging the whole question into an AI tool and getting the answers, we will be regularly checking the git pod, it will be noticable in your code, and it will harm your application. You can however use AI tools for code references, the sort of thing you might look up in docs e.g. "how do I split a string into an array of characters in Python" stuff like that. Remember that should you proceed to the next stage of interview, you will be asked to talk through your solutions to these problems, so make sure you understand what you are doing!

You can use any language you like! Section 1 is presented as a Jupyter notebook (an interactive file for running Python code), but if you're not using Python, just make new files called question_1, question_2, etc. Do try to be consistent with language across the whole of Section 1. Feel free to change for Section 2.

For Section 1 your code should be in a function, since we are letting you use whatever language you want you'll have to write these functions yourself - so make sure all the parameters are as outlined in the question!

Finally, feel free to add code blocks / files to test your code, and don't feel as though you have to delete these, it will be interesting for us to see your process!

If you have issues with git pod, or any other technical issues, please drop us an email and we will make necessary accomodations.
