Problem: JSON Message Processor System

Design and implement a system that processes incoming JSON messages of different types. Each message has a UUID and a type, and the system needs to handle each type differently.

NOTE Please use "example.json" to see the JSON format this file needs to be able to handle.

Requirements:

1. The system should be able to receive JSON messages, each containing at least a UUID and a type field.
2. There are three types of messages: A, B, and C.
3. For Type A messages:
   - They should be sent to an API endpoint immediately upon receipt (please create a mock POST request which sends the data WITHOUT the UUID)
4. For Type B messages:
   - They should be batched.
   - If adding a message to the batch makes the batch size equal to 5, send the entire batch to an endpoint (You could use the same endpoint as before, with the same constraints)
   - Only add a message to the batch if a message with the same UUID isn't already in the batch.
5. For Type C messages:
   - Save the UUID to an efficient storage type.

Initial Pseudocode (this is just a guide, it does not need to follow this exact format):

Class MessageProcessor:
    Method Initialize():
        Initialize empty message queue
        Initialize batch for Type B messages
        Initialize storage for Type C UUIDs

    Method ReceiveMessage(jsonMessage):`
        Add jsonMessage to message queue

    Method ProcessMessages():
        While message queue is not empty:
            message = Remove first message from queue
            ProcessMessage(message)

    Method ProcessMessage(message):
        messageType = ExtractMessageType(message)
        If messageType is "A":
            ProcessTypeA(message)
        Else If messageType is "B":
            ProcessTypeB(message)
        Else If messageType is "C":
            ProcessTypeC(message)
        Else:
            HandleUnknownMessageType(message)

    Method ProcessTypeA(message):
        SendToAPIEndpoint(message)

    Method ProcessTypeB(message):
        If message.UUID not in batch:
            Add message to batch
            If batch size == 5:
                SendBatchToEndpoint(batch)
                Clear batch

    Method ProcessTypeC(message):
        StoreUUID(message.UUID)

    Method SendToAPIEndpoint(message):
        // Send individual message to API endpoint

    Method SendBatchToEndpoint(batch):
        // Send batch of messages to API endpoint

    Method StoreUUID(UUID):
        // Store UUID in efficient storage type


Tasks:

1. System Implementation:
   Implement the MessageProcessor system, ensuring it meets all the given requirements. You can use your preferred programming language. Pay special attention to:
   - Efficient message queuing and processing
   - Correct handling of Type B message batching
   - Efficient storage for Type C message UUIDs
   - Error handling on the API
   - Clear logging throughout
   - Comments
